# Spatial-Pyramid-Matching-for-Scene-Classification

Implemented in MATLAB

The Project is done for the Computer Vision and Image Processing class CSE573 and all the necessary instructions are included in the instructions pdf file.


This system uses the bag-of-words approach with its Spatial Pyramid Extension for classifying the given image into 8 types of scenes.

Here are some key points:
1. The system has been trained with over 1600 images from the 8 scenes namely art_gallery, computer_room, garden, ice_scating, library, mountain, ocean, tennis_court.
2. It has an overall accuracy of 48.125 % of correctly classified images from a total of 160 test images.
3. Entire implementation code is in the MATLAB folder.
4. Test and training data is in the data folder.
