# Spatial-Pyramid-Matching-for-Scene-Classification

Implemented in MATLAB

This system uses the bag-of-words approach with its Spatial Pyramid Extension for classifying the given image into 8 types of scenes.

Here are some key points:
1. The system has been trained with over 1600 images from the 8 scenes namely art_gallery, computer_room, garden, ice_scating, library, mountain, ocean, tennis_court.
2. It has an overall accuracy of 48.125 % of correctly classified images from a total of 160 test images.
3. Entire implementation code is in the MATLAB folder.
4. Test and training data is in the data folder.
